# HR Analytics Dashboard: Attrition Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data to uncover insights and trends that can aid organizations in understanding and addressing workforce challenges. By leveraging interactive visualizations, the HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key metrics (KPIs) and patterns related to employee attrition, enabling data-driven decision-making for HR teams.

## Business Problem
- **Employee attrition is a critical issue that affects organizational productivity, morale, and costs. This project aims to address the following questions:**

### 1. What is the overall attrition rate in the organization?
### 2. Which departments, salary ranges, and job roles have the highest attrition rates?
### 3. How do age, education field, and tenure impact employee attrition?
### 4 .Are there any actionable insights to mitigate high attrition areas?

## Key Features and Insights
### 1. Overall Metrics

- **Attrition Rate: 16.2%**
- **Average Salary: 6.52K**
- **Average Age: 36.93 years**
- **Average Tenure: 7.04 years**
### 2. Attrition by Salary and Age

- **Most attrition occurs in lower salary slabs (Upto 5K: 50.74%) and among younger employees (26-35 years: 585).**
### 3. Attrition by Education Field

- **Fields most affected: Life Sciences (585) and Medical (440).**
### 4. Attrition by Job Role

- **Key roles with high attrition: Laboratory Technician (60) and Sales Executive (55).**
### 5. Years at Company

- **Attrition peaks early (1 year: 57 employees).**
### 6. Gender Breakdown

- **Male employees (123) show higher attrition compared to females (71).**

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Power BI: For creating the interactive dashboard and visualizations.**
- **Excel: For data cleaning and preprocessing.**

## Potential Business Impact
- **Reduce attrition by focusing on high-risk groups (e.g., younger employees and lower salary brackets).**
- **Design targeted retention programs for vulnerable job roles like Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives.**
- **Optimize hiring strategies by analyzing patterns in tenure and education fields.**


## Conclusion
- **The analysis highlights that attrition is most prevalent among younger employees, lower salary slabs, and specific job roles like Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives. Education fields such as Life Sciences and Medical are significantly impacted. Additionally, attrition peaks early in tenure, suggesting a need for improved onboarding and retention strategies. These insights can help organizations design targeted interventions to reduce attrition and improve employee satisfaction.**
